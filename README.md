Created suitable representations for each geo-spatial time series from https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/gps-watch-data.
Created 2 embedding algorithms, first one for comparing time series based on the speed and second one based on bearings. 
As a solutions for this task i provided a similarity matrix for all the files for first and second algorithm and a t-SNE visualization</p>
